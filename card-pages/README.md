# Card Pages Features System

This document explains how to use the standardized features section that has been added to all individual card pages.

## Overview

The features section provides a consistent, comparable format for displaying key card information across all pages. It includes three main sections:

1. **üí≥ Earning Rates** - How the card earns points/miles
2. **üéÅ Perks & Benefits** - Luxury benefits and exclusive access
3. **üõ°Ô∏è Protections** - Insurance and security features

## Structure

The features section is placed between the hero section and the callout box on every card page. It uses a responsive grid layout that automatically adjusts based on screen size.

### HTML Structure

## Customization Guidelines

### Earning Rates Section

- **Subtitle**: Change to reflect the specific point/mile system (e.g., "How you earn Membership Rewards points")
- **Categories**: List the main earning categories with their multipliers
- **Format**: Use consistent formatting like "Xx points" or "Xx miles"
- **Order**: List highest earning rate first, then descending

### Perks Section

- **Subtitle**: Usually keep as "Luxury benefits and exclusive access"
- **Icons**: Use relevant emojis for each perk (‚úàÔ∏è for travel, üè® for hotels, etc.)
- **Content**: Focus on premium benefits that differentiate the card
- **Quantity**: Aim for 4-6 key perks to maintain visual balance

### Protections Section

- **Subtitle**: Usually keep as "Insurance and security features"
- **Icons**: Use relevant emojis for each protection type
- **Content**: List the main insurance and security features
- **Quantity**: Aim for 4-6 key protections

## Adding New Cards

When creating a new card page:

1. **Copy the template**: Use `card-template.html` as your starting point
2. **Update the features section**: Replace the placeholder content with card-specific information
3. **Maintain consistency**: Keep the same structure and styling
4. **Test responsiveness**: Ensure the grid works well on mobile devices

## Styling

The features section uses CSS Grid with responsive breakpoints:

- **Desktop**: 3-column grid
- **Tablet**: 2-column grid (when space allows)
- **Mobile**: Single-column stack

All styling is handled in `card-styles.css` and automatically applies to new pages.

## Benefits

This standardized approach provides:

- **Consistency**: All cards look and feel the same
- **Comparability**: Users can easily compare features across cards
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new cards with minimal effort
- **Maintainability**: Changes to styling affect all pages automatically
- **SEO**: Structured content that search engines can understand
