            <h1>About Cards for Normals</h1>
            <p>We're tired of credit card advice that assumes you want to become a points expert</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Why We Started This</h2>
            <p>The credit card world is full of conflicting advice, endless Reddit threads, and "experts" trying to convince you that you need 17 different cards to optimize every purchase category.</p>
            
            <p>But here's the thing: most people just want a straightforward answer. They want to know which card makes sense for their actual life, not for some theoretical optimal-spending scenario that requires a spreadsheet to manage.</p>

            <p>We built Cards for Normals because we believe good financial advice should be simple, honest, and focused on what actually matters in real life.</p>

            <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
            <p>Credit cards are tools, not hobbies. A good card should make your life easier, not more complicated. Sometimes the "optimal" choice on paper is terrible in practice if it requires constant mental overhead.</p>

            <p>We're not here to turn you into a points maximizer or convince you to apply for cards with $500 annual fees. We're here to help you find the card that fits your spending, your goals, and your tolerance for complexity.</p>

                    <h4>We Answer Your Actual Question</h4>
                    <p>No 20-paragraph blog posts about card history. Just clear, direct answers to what you're actually wondering about.</p>

                    <p>We're not affiliate marketers trying to convince you to sign up for premium cards. Our recommendations are based on what actually makes sense.</p>

                    <p>We'll tell you when simple beats optimal, and when the mental overhead isn't worth the extra rewards.</p>

                    <h4>Real Math, Not Marketing</h4>
                    <p>We calculate break-even points, factor in annual fees, and show you the actual dollar impact of different strategies.</p>

                <h4>üí° Our Promise</h4>
                <p>We'll never recommend a card or strategy without explaining exactly why it makes sense for your situation. And we'll always be honest when the simple option is better than the "optimal" one.</p>
